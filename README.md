# Quipnotes

This project was inspired by the hit game called ["Ransom Notes" by Very Special Games](https://www.veryspecialgames.com/products/ransom-notes-the-ridiculous-word-magnet-game). The best way to experience this game is to buy the original and use the prompt cards located there. 

## The Problem

My family loves the game "Quiplash" by Jackbox Games because it is easy to play and we can enjoy it from the comfort of our living room. We've recently discovered Ransom Notes and also love it! But we wanted to enoy the same level of convenience that "Quiplash" offers. Therefore, I thought of putting my expertise together to make this!
